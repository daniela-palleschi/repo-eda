(2018): a direct EEG1 replication (versus conceptual replication)\n\n\n\na multi-lab replication of DeLong et al. (2005)’s impactful paper\n\nDeLong et al. (2005): reported N400 effects elicted at unexpected nouns, but also on preceding determiners (English a/an) when it signalled an unexpected word,\n\ne.g., The day was breezy so the boy went outside to fly…a kite/*an airplane\ntaken as evidence of pre-activation of phonological form, graded by cloze probability\n\nNieuwland et al. (2018): replicated N400 at noun, but not at adjective\n\ni.e., failure to replicate a famous finding"
